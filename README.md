# Im AsyDNS (Asymmetric DNS)

My task in this world is provide DNS names to all the people that has an Asymmetric Cryptography Key Pair

I can give you awesome names like:

e6e9b4c019af6b1787780b2d25a94c1e960760474ce5544499efcff9.a.asydns.org

Ok, maybe not an "awesome name", but a really dynamic name.

What do you need?

1. Generate a public/private key pair
2. Claim your asydns.org subdomain
3. Probe (cryptographically) that you have the private key of the key pair
4. Done! You have an AsyDNS subdomain!  :)
